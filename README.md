## TODO:
- [ ] Create a state that is the `vibe context` (e.g. A meeting) so that it can be displayed like `vibe for today's meeting` so these responses can all get aggregated in the same place.
- [ ] Create a button to create a new page or `vibe context`, so say the GitHub OAuth user JakeRoggenbuck can create a new page called `General Meeting 1` with the random code `867976` that others can visit from the url bar
- [ ] Create a backend for different pages, their questions, and a place to submit the feedback
- [ ] Create a frontend prompt when creating a new page that allows you to make multiple questions that can either be answered with stars or a comment box
